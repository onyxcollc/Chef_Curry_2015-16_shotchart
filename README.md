## Background

My last project we went on a journey in discovering the pure dominance of LeBron James, but we’re going to switch gears and analyze the anomaly that is Stephen Curry.  Curry’s basketball career has been nothing but sensational to watch. He’s proven himself to NBA fans numerous of times his impact on the game. With 7 All Star appearances, 3 NBA Championships, 2 MVP titles, 1 scoring title, and he also holds the record for most 3pts made in one season, with 402 made. 

402 is the number I want us to focus on; using nba_api, phyton, matplotlib library, seaborn library, and tableau, I’ll show a different perspective on why that number is out of this world.

#### Leaders

Using Tableau, I was able create a scatter plot that showed the top 14 all-time 3pt leaders in a single season.  In the years leading up to Ray Allen’s record breaking 2005-06 NBA season, Allen (ranked 14th) at that time was a great 3pt shooter (right next to Reggie Miller) that we’ve ever seen, with 269 threes made.  That record would stand the test of time until Stephen Curry (ranked 1st, 3rd, 4th, 7th & 10th) stepped on the court in the 2012-13 season. It only took 6 years to break Allen’s record; Curry ending the season with 272 threes made. After the 2013-14 season Curry followed his 2012-13 performance with another record-breaking 2014-15 season with 286 threes made, just 2 years after his first attempt. Klay Thompson (ranked 9th) tried to keep up with Curry in his yet again record breaking 2015-16 season with 276 threes made, but nowhere close to Curry’s 402 threes made.


Players like James Harden (ranked 2nd & 5th), Paul George (ranked 6th), Damian Lillard (ranked 12th), Buddy Hield (ranked 8th, 11th) needed to step there game up to even compete, and this was in the 2019-20 season, so that meant Curry reigned supreme for 5 consecutive years as 3pt King. Harden is the only player to have had a breakout season in 2018-19 with 378 threes made. Curry’s 2014-15 season was better then some players on the list competing in 2019-20 season.

So now that you understand Stephen Curry’s greatness, let us look at where exactly Curry likes to shoot the ball compared to Ray Allen’s shot choice since the torch was passed down between those two.
