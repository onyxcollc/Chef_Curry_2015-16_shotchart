## Background

My last project we went on a journey in discovering the pure dominance of LeBron James, but we’re going to switch gears and analyze the anomaly that is Stephen Curry.  Curry’s basketball career has been nothing but sensational to watch. He’s proven himself to NBA fans numerous of times his impact on the game. With 7 All Star appearances, 3 NBA Championships, 2 MVP titles, 1 scoring title, and he also holds the record for most 3pts made in one season, with 402 made. 

402 is the number I want us to focus on; using nba_api, phyton, matplotlib library, seaborn library, and tableau, I’ll show a different perspective on why that number is out of this world.
